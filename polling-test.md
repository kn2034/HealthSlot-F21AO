# Jenkins Polling Test

This file is created to test if Jenkins polling is properly set up and detecting changes to the repository.

## Test Information

- **Date**: March 21, 2025
- **Branch**: qa
- **Purpose**: Verify Jenkins polling configuration

## Expected Behavior

If polling is correctly configured in Jenkins, a build should be automatically triggered within 5 minutes of pushing this commit to the repository.

## Recent Fixes

1. Fixed issue with lint script not being found
2. Fixed node label in post actions
3. Set up polling on Jenkins to detect changes every 5 minutes

To verify if polling is working, check if a build is automatically triggered shortly after this commit.
